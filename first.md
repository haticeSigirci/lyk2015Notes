OOP(Object Oriented Programming) CONCEPTS in JAVA
1)Polymorphism
We examined polymorphism principle. Polymorphism subclasses of a class can define their own unique behaviors and yet share some of the same functionality of the parent class.
2)Encapsulation
Access modifiers are keywords in the Java language to use access a method,an instance or a class. These are public(field, method, class), protected(field,method), private(field,method).Also,these modifiers are used for Encapsulation(OOP) to hide the implementation.
3)Abstraction
We use them to collect the same functionality in one method in this way we can ignore the copy-paste code.Another usage is hiding internal details of the other classes.
An abstract class cannot create with new keyword.Between the abstract classes have is-a relationship. If we extends the an abstract class in this case subclass are concrete class.
We can use two ways for the abstraction interface or abstract class. 
If we extend an abstract class, we mustn't implement all methods abstract class,but if we implement an interface, we must implement all methods interface. Also, in a class we implements one or more interface but we cannot extend one or more abstract class so we can extend only one abstract class.

4)Inheritance
Inheritance allows a child class to inherit properties from its parent class. For example, we have a bank account and we use this account,saving money or checking money. But, this account has common properties in this case savings and checking accounts inherit common state from the superclass (account).
